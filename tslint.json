     tslint:recommended is a stable, somewhat opinionated set of rules which we encourage for general TypeScript programming. This configuration follows semver, so it will not have breaking changes across minor or patch releases.

        tslint:latest extends tslint:recommended and is continuously updated to include 
        configuration for the latest rules in every TSLint release. Using this config may 
        introduce breaking changes across minor releases as new rules are enabled which 
        cause lint failures in your code. When TSLint reaches a major version bump, 
        tslint:recommended will be updated to be identical to tslint:latest.
